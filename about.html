    <h2> Our Mission</h2>
    <p> Baby<a class="yellow">Academy</a> is an app created by two high-school students, <strong>Tomás Philippart</strong> (Portuguese/French) and <strong>André Hernández</strong> (Mexican), both living in Portugal.
The idea was originally born as a casual project, later developed furthermore, and based on the existence of the books “How To Teach Your Baby To Read”, “How To Teach Your Baby Math” and “How To Teach Your Baby To Be Physically Superb” by Glenn Doman.
Known as the Doman Method, the app is supported by a technique that uses toddlers’ capacity of learning from an early age, associating it with an interactive and “fun” task. Most parents consider their children to be too young to be able to learn and prefer to wait until later. However, the Doman Method suggests an early start, in order to establish not only a better cognitive function and intellect of the child but also physical aspects such as coordination, physical development and others.
The program also expands to children with special needs, attending to their specific necessities and issues, adjusting the program accordingly after the first evaluation.
